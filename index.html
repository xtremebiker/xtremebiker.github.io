        <p>Last year, when I was sharing a car to work with seven or eight more people, I considered to implement
          some kind of application to decide who should be driving his/her car each of the days. It seems somehow easy
          to decide it,
          but when you are many people, some of them could take the day off at work, get sick, even some of them don't
          have a car...
          There are many cases to take into account, so it deserves having a program to make the choice for us. So let's
          start planning it!
        </p>
        <p id="architecture" class="h4">The architecture</p>
        <p>Since the very beginning I've thought of two different servers, one to host the Single Sign On (SSO)
          solution
          (<a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">keycloak</a> in my case) and the other one for the application itself.
          Since I planned to build my application using <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">spring boot</a>
          and
          it already has wide Oauth2 - Open Id Connect support, the communication between the servers is done almost
          seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, I'll be running <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> in both of the servers, using it's
          <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker compose</a> tool to run a basic orchestration in each of
          them. The SSO server
          will have a mariadb database instance where keycloak persists its data. Also a web based DB admin tool such as
          <a href="https://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpmyadmin</a> will be available, in order to
          provide DB management from any device. The HTTP requests from the outside world will be made through a <a
            href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx server</a>
          acting as a reverse proxy, managing the SSL certificates to encrypt the communication. The second server
          containing my own application happens to be
          almost the identical in architectural means.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <a href="images/architecture.png">
            <img src="images/architecture.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail">
          </a>
        </div>
        <p id="domain" class="h4">Domain and hosting</p>
        <p>Well, I decided to go with the infrastructure firstly.
          It might sound a bit weird, but having spent the last years mostly as a web developer,
          I had never dealt with hosting/domain administration myself before, so it was the perfect time to start with
          it!
          I chose the <a href="https://www.ovh.com">OVH provider</a>, so I signed up in their site to set
          up my own domain:
        </p>
        <a href="images/domain.png">
          <img src="images/domain.png" class="img-fluid">
        </a>
        <p>The next step was to order the servers:
          OVH provides virtual servers at a very affordable price, so I chose the cheapest plan, with 1 virtual core and
          2 GB of RAM,
          considering that the traffic won't be too high, this should be enough to fulfill my needs. The OS I chose was
          Ubuntu Server 18.04.</p>
        <p>Once I had the domain and the servers, I wanted the servers to have names in that domain: I set up two
          subdomains
          into my main domain, which are <span class="font-italic">auth.quienconduce.com</span> for the SSO server and
          <span class="font-italic">www.quienconduce.com</span> for my
          application. Those names are registered as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME DNS records</a> and mapped to the OVH virtual
          server names.
        </p>
        <p>Since I wanted my application to look a bit of professional, I also bought a mail service for my
          domain. The cheapest OVH fares offers up to five accounts, which
          seemed more than enough for what I need. This will be the mail server for sending the e-mail messages for
          the users Sign Up process and notifications:
        </p>
        <a href="images/mailing.png">
          <img src="images/mailing.png" class="img-fluid">
        </a>
        <p>Apart from this, I also wanted the main domain name
          to redirect to my application. This means, redirect <span class="font-italic">quienconduce.com requests
            to</span> <span class="font-italic">https://www.quienconduce.com</span>,
          so I assigned a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">permanent visible redirection</a> for this, returning the
          301 HTTP code as a response
          and pointing to my application url when requested. This is the whole picture of my redirections,
          including the ones for the mail server and all the applications:
        </p>

          <img src="images/redirections.png" class="img-fluid">
        </a>
        <p id="ssh" class="h4">Talking to the servers</p>
        <p>I'm using Linux Mint in my PC at home, where the SSH client package is already installed, so connecting to
          the servers is
          a one liner such as:
          <pre><code>> ssh root@www.quienconduce.com</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>Anyway,
          keep in mind that using the root user directly isn't advisable, so better create a standard user and add it to
          the sudoers group with these steps:
          <pre><code>> adduser aritz
> usermod -aG sudo aritz</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then log in with the standard user and use <span class="font-weight-bold">sudo</span> when required:
          <pre><code>> ssh aritz@www.quienconduce.com</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p id="sso" class="h4">keycloak as my SSO solution</p>
        <p>Keycloak is a Single Sign On solution brought by Red Hat, which
          provides:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User Management</li>
          <li><a href="https://oauth.net/">OAuth flow</a> implementations, including <a
              href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenId Connect</a> support</li>
          <li>High compatibility with the java spring framework</li>
          <li>"Skinnable" login page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The main advantage of using an already built open source product for securizing any application is that there
          are many people working on it, who are considered to have
          more expertise in the security field than myself or any full stack focused programmer. The IT security by
          itself is a complex subject, so better use already available libs/software,
          as long as they are backed by trusted companies - communities.
        </p>
        <p>Keycloak is compatible with some of
          the most popular database engines, but I decided myself to use mariadb, instead of relying in the built in H2
          database, which is not advisable for production stages. Here it is my
          <span class="font-italic">docker-compose.yml</span> configuration:
        </p>
        <pre><code>version: '2'
  services:
    mariadb:
      ports:
        - '127.0.0.1:3306:3306'
      image: mariadb:10.4.5-bionic
      container_name: mariadb
      volumes:
        - /home/aritz/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
      environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
        MYSQL_DATABASE: keycloak
        MYSQL_USER: keycloak
        MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    keycloak:
      image: jboss/keycloak
      container_name: keycloak
      environment:
        DB_VENDOR: MARIADB
        DB_ADDR: mariadb
        DB_DATABASE: keycloak
        DB_USER: root
        DB_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
        KEYCLOAK_USER: keycloak
        KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD: ${KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD}
        PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING: 'true'
      ports:
        - 8080:8080
      depends_on:
        - mariadb
      restart: on-failure</code></pre>
        <p>Basically, this downloads the images of MariaDB and keycloak from the <a
            href="https://hub.docker.com/">docker Hub</a> and launches them in two containers, so as the SSO
          instance connects to the database. Also a user named "keycloak" will be created in the SSO server.</p>
        <p>Couple of security related things here, in the mariadb container
          the port 3306 from the host is binded to the 3306 of the container, but
          apart from this I added the localhost address before, meaning that the DB server will only be available in the
          host machine. Also the passwords are set in docker environment variables, which
          are grabbed from an <span class="font-italic">.env</span> file in the same directory of
          the compose file, thus not being uploaded to the source control.</p>

        <p id="db-client" class="h4">Managing the database through a web-based client</p>
        <p>Having a web based client available is quite convenient, in order to be able to make changes
          from any browser. If we want to use a more advanced desktop client, we can configure SSH tunneling later on.
          The most popular tool for mysql/mariadb administration
          is phpmyadmin, so let's configure it in our docker compose file:
        </p>
        <pre><code>phpmyadmin:
  image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
  links:
    - mariadb:db
  ports:
    - 8081:80
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    PMA_ABSOLUTE_URI: https://db.auth.quienconduce.com</code></pre>
        <p id="nginx" class="h4">Nginx proxy</p>
        <p>With the given configuration, I've got three applications running: Mariadb, bound in the 3306 port, keycloak
          running in 8080 and phpmyadmin in 8081. But I would like to give names to
          these services to be publicly accessible. keycloak should be accessible by <span
            class="font-italic">https://auth.quienconduce.com</span> and
          phpmyadmin in <span class="font-italic">https://db.auth.quienconduce.com</span>, as I have already defined
          in my DNS registries. This task can be done configuring a reverse proxy at the top of them, so I chose to
          use <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a> for this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>nginx:
  image: valian/docker-nginx-auto-ssl
  restart: on-failure
  ports:
    - 80:80
    - 443:443
  volumes:
    - ssl_data:/etc/resty-auto-ssl
    - /home/aritz/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d
  links:
    - phpmyadmin:phpmyadmin
    - keycloak:keycloak
  environment:
    ALLOWED_DOMAINS: 'quienconduce.com'</code></pre>
        <p>This isn't the standard nginx docker container, but a customized docker image which allows to
          integrate automatic SSL certificate generation for our site
          (thanks <a href="https://github.com/Valian/docker-nginx-auto-ssl">@Valian</a> ;-)).
          We need to configure two
          docker volumes for this, the one needed for resty ssl data and
          the other for the nginx config itself. In our host machine, let's place two configuration files in
          <span class="font-italic">/home/aritz/nginx</span>:</p>
        <pre><code>server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name auth.quienconduce.com;

  include resty-server-https.conf;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://keycloak:8080;  
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}</code></pre>

        <pre><code>server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name db.auth.quienconduce.com;

  include resty-server-https.conf;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://phpmyadmin;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>This will make nginx proxy-pass the requests made to <span
            class="font-italic">https://auth.quienconduce.com</span> and <span
            class="font-italic">https://db.auth.quienconduce.com</span> to the keycloak and phpmyadmin servers,
          including the request headers defined. Here I use the docker aliases of the services to specify the host
          for the <span class="font-italic">proxy_pass</span> rule. However, for some reason I had to manually specify
          the
          port for keycloak, nginx wasn't able to find it otherwise.</p>
        <p id="run-sso" class="h4">Running the SSO server</p>
        <p>After the docker compose file is configured, we just have to run this command to have everything up and
          running:</p>
        <pre><code>sudo docker-compose up -d</code></pre>
        <p>After this, we can see that both SSO and database admin servers are accessible through their DNS names in a
          secure
          manner:</p>

        <p id="backups" class="h4">Configuring the DB backups</p>
        <p>I wanted the DB to be backed up to some external site in case the server hard disk crashes or the information
          is lost after some fatal failure. So I wrote an script which uses <a
            href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone">rclone</a> and copies the dump of the database content
          to my dropbox account:</p>
        <pre><code>docker exec mariadb mysqldump -u user -pmypass keycloak --single-transaction > /home/aritz/auth.sql
rclone --config="/home/aritz/.config/rclone/rclone.conf" copy /home/aritz/auth.sql dropbox:backups</code></pre>
        <p>The rclone configuration file contains my dropbox account access token, so I set the script to run every
          night in the crontab,
          with the docker compose script configured to run in every reboot alongside:</p>
        <pre><code>00 00 * * * /home/aritz/backup.sh  >> /var/log/backup.log 2>&1
@reboot /home/aritz/docker-compose.sh   >> /var/log/docker-compose.log 2>&1</code></pre>
        <p id="jhipster" class="h4">Fast web application generation using jHipster</p>
        <p>Even if spring boot provides a great way to set up web applications in a breeze, I wanted to speed up the
          process and
          decided to use the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">jHipster</a> application generator. This tool is
          amazing since it lets you
          design your own entity domain model and then generate both the backend code written in java - spring and the
          front end using either Angular
          or ReactJs: In my case, I chose Angular. This is a snapshot of the web entity generator:</p>

        <p id="continuous-integration" class="h4">Configuring the continuous integration in gitlab</p>
        <p>After finishing the set up and checked that everything was compiling, I uploaded my git repo to gitlab. This
          platform provides continuous integration
          with pipelines for different stages, so it's quite handy for my project, even if I'm the only developer
          working on it.</p>
        <p>The stages defined in my pipeline
          configuration file are build and test. Inside them, the maven and node docker images are used to build the
          software and pass the test benchmarks, also
          the dependencies are configured to be cached to speed up the pipeline process.
          I want it to make the deployment in the future too, which basically generates the application
          docker image which is uploaded to the docker hub.
